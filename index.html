        <dt class="dt">Fun Travelling</dt>
        <dd>There’s no doubt that ‘travel’ is the perfect medicine to soothe one’s mind and soul. My love for travel is so strong that taking a trip every now & then boosts my efficiency in the other fields of my life. I just love exploring places, be it alone or with friends or family as it also helps me gain a fresh perspective about life. Here are some places that I had always wanted to visit, so when it came to picking a destination for my trips, I immediately finalized them. Be it its scenic beauty or its lip-smacking food, everything seemed too fascinating. So, I also wanted to ensure that everything is rightly planned for my trips. But, somehow unplanned trips are the best.</dd>
